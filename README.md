## Portfolio Site

A basic copy of my portfolio site.

- portfolio.sql file has the database setup.
- app/includes/config.php have the database details.
- template2017 is the name of the current theme and views. Copy this folder to make a new theme.
- app/includes/settings.php update theme name.

### Adding a new project

- Add a new project to the database filling in the details.
- Add a new folder in the images/projects folder with the name of the project.
- This name should be what is entered into the identifier field in the database.
- Each image can then be named identifier-1.jpg, identifier-2.jpg etc.
- Each project can be tured on / off in the active column in the project table.
